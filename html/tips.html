 <h1>TIPS</h1>
</center>
<hr>
You can drag files into the file list and the files will be moved there
<hr>
You can drag files out of the file list and they will be copied.
<hr>
If you drop a file or disk icon (volume) onto the image window, Peek will change directory to that
folder or volume.
<hr>
If you're tired of being asked whether or not you want to copy/move/create link a file you've dragged,
you can select the default in the Mouse options.
<hr>
Peek will start up in the state you left it in (mostly).
