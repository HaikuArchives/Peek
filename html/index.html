<h2>Version 0.72</h2>

After quite a while of nothing, I've released this version with a couple of bugs fixed
and a couple of things removed/added/fixed.

<h2>Different languages and language files</h2>
Since version 0.6, Peek has support for multiple languages built into it.  I only speak english fairly well and all my other
languages aren't too hot so I've only included an English file.<br>
You could create your own language (and have Peek support it) by copying the "english" file in the
"languages" directory to another name - say "swahili" - and translate all the lines into your preferred 
language. Then you can restart Peek and select your language.
<p>
You need not bother to send me your language file at the moment (if you want to actually do that) because
the language requirements will usually change.  I guess you can send me an email telling me that you've
done it and then I can put a link up to your page on my site. :-) 
<p>
RULES FOR LANGUAGE FILES
<ul>
<li>Every entry occurs on only one line
<li>The character "+" is read to be a newline (i.e. enter or '\n')
<li>There must be an empty line at the bottom of the language file
<li>There must be the correct number of lines in the file.
</ul>
