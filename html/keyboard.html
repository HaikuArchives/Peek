Hi.: A few of the important menu commands have short-cuts and you can find out
what they are by looking in the Menu.  However, there are others which are not
easily visible because they either aren't "menu" material or because they affect
the functioning of certain parts of Peek. <br> Here they are:


<TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1">
  <tr><td align="right">ESC
          <td align="left">If a slideshow is busy running, ESC will stop it.<br>
                                     &nbsp;  else, Peek will quit.<P>
                                     This is quite useful because if you double click on an image icon in Tracker and Peek
                                     loads, you can just press ESC and it's gone.. 
  <tr><td align="right">CTRL
          <td align="left">Holding down CTRL *BEFORE* you begin dragging an image or thumbnail will
                                     switch between the different drag & drop modes.  IE, if you've set negotiated
                                     drag & drop as your default, holding ctrl will toggle simple drag & drop until you've
                                     released it.
  <tr><td align="right">Spacebar
           <td align="left">This will select the next image in the file list.
